# Vercel Deployment Guide

This project is configured to deploy as a static site on Vercel.

## Quick Deploy

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Click "Add New..." → "Project"
3. Import your Git repository
4. Framework Preset: **Other** (or leave as auto-detected)
5. Build & Development Settings:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist` (This is auto-configured in `vercel.json`)
   - **Install Command**: `npm install` (or leave as default)
6. Click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally (if not already installed)
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

## Configuration

The project includes a `vercel.json` configuration file that sets the **Output Directory** to `dist`. Vercel automatically serves all files from this directory.

## File Structure

```
/
├── index.html              # Main HTML file
├── css/                    # Stylesheets
├── js/                     # JavaScript modules
├── assets/                 # Images and other assets
├── public/                 # Public files (favicon, etc.)
├── build.js                # Node.js script for building the site
├── package.json            # NPM configuration
└── vercel.json             # Vercel deployment configuration
/dist/                      # (Generated by build)
├── index.html
└── ... (all other static assets)
```

## Build Process

This project uses a simple Node.js script (`build.js`) to prepare for deployment.
Running `npm run build` will:
1. Create a `dist` directory.
2. Copy all necessary static files (`index.html`, `css`, `js`, `assets`, `public`) into the `dist` directory.

This `dist` directory is the deployment artifact that Vercel serves.

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment fails
- Ensure `npm install` is run before `npm run build` if there are any dependencies.
- Check the Vercel build logs for errors originating from the `build.js` script.

### Assets not loading
- Ensure all file paths in `index.html` start with `/` (absolute paths from the root of the site).
- Verify that the necessary files were copied correctly into the `dist` directory after running the build.

## Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for this static site.

## Custom Domain

After deployment, you can add a custom domain in the Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Click "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain and follow DNS configuration instructions

- Edge network CDN
- HTTPS certificates
